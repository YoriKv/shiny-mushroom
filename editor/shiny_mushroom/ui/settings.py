"""The app-wide preference store, and typed readers for it.

One :class:`QSettings` object identified explicitly rather than inherited from
the :class:`QApplication`: Qt's no-argument constructor reads
``organizationName``/``applicationName`` off the running application, which
means the store a test or a script gets depends on whether a bootstrap happened
to run first. Naming it here makes the location the same everywhere, and lets
:func:`shiny_mushroom.app.main` leave the organization unset (see the note there).

Preferences here are properties of the *person*, not of what they have open -
theme, window geometry, view toggles. Anything belonging to a document belongs
in the document.

**Read a preference through the typed accessor for its type, never through
``settings().value()``.** The store keeps text, not Python objects: a ``True``
written here comes back out of the INI file - and out of the Windows registry,
where the app's native store is - as the string ``"true"``, so an untyped read
yields a value that is truthy, is not ``True``, and passes every casual test of
it. The trap hides itself, because within one process Qt's config cache answers
from the object that was written rather than from the file; the string only
appears once the value has genuinely been read back, which on Linux means the
next launch. Backing every preference with an accessor here is what keeps that
difference from reaching the rest of the app.

Each accessor names its type, so there is no way to read a preference without
saying what it is meant to be, and each falls back to the caller's default
rather than raising: a config someone has hand-edited, or one written by a
newer build, must never stop the app from starting.
