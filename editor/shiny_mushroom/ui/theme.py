"""The app-wide light/dark appearance, in one palette applied in one place.

The editor themes through **QPalette**, not a stylesheet. Every widget already
draws from palette roles -- the toolbars' marks are stamped with the theme's
ink, the tables wash their selection out of Highlight, the memory map derives
its flat ground from the surface -- so handing the application a different
palette re-colors the whole UI without a per-widget rule anywhere. The only
literals left are the ones that are deliberately *not* theme colors - the
canvas backing and its grid - which have to read the same against the artwork
whichever theme is on.

**Both themes run on Fusion.** The native Windows and macOS styles paint many
controls from platform colors and ignore the application palette, so a dark
palette under them comes out half-light; Fusion honours the palette everywhere
and ships on every platform Qt does. Using it for light as well is what makes a
screenshot from one machine describe the app on the others -- and what lets a
theme be a *palette* here rather than a palette plus a note about which platform
it looks right on. ``setColorScheme`` is requested alongside for the parts a
palette cannot reach - most visibly the Windows title bar - and is a no-op where
the platform cannot honour it, which is exactly why the palettes below are built
here rather than left to Qt's own dark scheme.

**A theme is a data row** (:class:`_PaletteSpec`, tabulated in
:data:`_PALETTES`): a surface color to derive the whole palette from, plus the
handful of roles whose derived value is wrong. ``QPalette(QColor)`` computes
window, button, text and the Light/Mid/Dark/Shadow bevel shades from that one
color, so a theme is a seed to turn rather than forty constants to keep
consistent - and adding one is a row here, not a code path. Light is the
exception in the other direction: it names no surface, because Fusion's own
``standardPalette()`` is already a tuned light palette and there is nothing to
improve on by re-deriving it.
