"""Access to bundled, read-only assets shipped inside the package.

Keeping them *inside* ``shiny_mushroom`` (rather than in a sibling data directory)
means they are packaged into the wheel and collected into a frozen build.

Paths are resolved with :mod:`importlib.resources`, not relative to
``__file__``: PyInstaller relocates package data into a temporary directory, so
a ``__file__``-relative lookup finds nothing in a release build while working
perfectly in a checkout - the worst kind of bug to discover after tagging.
